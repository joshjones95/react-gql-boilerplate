# React - GraphQL Boilerplate application

## GraphQL
What is GraphQL? - https://graphql.org/

### GraphQL Adaptor
To connect to a GraphQL endpoint, apollo is used. For more information on apollo client - https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/

In order to save time defining GQL schema types and developing hooks, https://graphql-code-generator.com is used to automatically generate these for you. To get started with GraphQL in this application, simply rename the codegen.yml.example file (dropping the .example), point to your schema and start adding the desired queries, mutations or subscriptions to the graphql folder.
